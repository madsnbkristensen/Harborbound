# Unity 2D Core Template Project

## Overview

Welcome to the Unity 2D Core Template Project! This repository serves as a starting point for your 2D game development journey using Unity. It provides a barebones Unity project setup with essential configurations, ensuring that you can dive straight into bringing your game ideas to life.

## Getting Started

To use this template for your own project, follow these steps:
